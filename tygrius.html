  <h1>Tygrius "Evertall" Thuliaga</h1>
  <p>
    The "Thuliaga" clan resided in the "Spine of the World" near "Reghed
    Glacier". We were a very tall tribe for Goliaths and I was the tallest of
    all, standing at eight foot, 2 inches. Being a mountain tribe, we faced many
    challenges but always found a way to live comfortably, until Barbarians of
    the Gray Wolf showed up. <br />
    <br />
    We had seen tracks of their tribe before but never had they come so close to
    us. That night they were on the prowl looking for easy prey. The first
    scream was from the clan's "Tent-Mother"...my mother. Her scream mixed with
    the snarling of a dog. <br />
    <br />
    I jumped out of my bed, grabbed my axe and shield, and ran out of my tent to
    see a lycanthrope gnawing at my mother's throat. I quickly looked around to
    find a pack of six lycans and many dead Goliath bodies. Other fighters came
    out and began to fight these lycans. <br />
    <br />
    I ran to the one eating my mother and struck it down in one swift blow. Head
    and shoulder severed as I sliced the wolf in two. My mother was dead. I
    turned to see who else I would chop down. My tribesmen were dead and two
    other lycans still remained. I am not sure what happened next as I must have
    been blinded by the rage and anguish of seeing my mother torn apart by an
    animal. When I came to I was the only being still alive on that
    mountainside. <br />
    <br />
    I buried every single body in that cold ground, lycan included. I travelled
    down that mountain towards Neverwinter, nothing left for me on that mountain
    except death and memories. <br />
